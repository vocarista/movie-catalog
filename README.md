# This is a front-end application for the data fetched by the API: https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=all
# It's a demo for how the booking interface would look like, had it been posting data through an API.
# This is a work in progress and I'll be making changes to it as I find time.
# Suggestions are always welcomed.
